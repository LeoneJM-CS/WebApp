                    Colorado Vanguard FC is a Christ-centered soccer program built for 
                    players who want more than a typical team experience. We combine high-level 
                    training with intentional mentorship, creating an environment where athletes grow in both ability and character.
                </p>

                Our identity as a Christian club isn't a slogan — it's woven into our rhythm:
                <ul class="ul">
                    <li class="li">Team prayer before and after games</li>
                    <li class="li">Short devotionals and character talks</li>
                    <li class="li">Service opportunities within the community</li>
                    <li class="li">Expectations that reflect Christlike conduct</li>
                    <li class="li">Coaches who mentor both the athlete and the person</li>
                </ul>
                We compete hard, but we compete differently — with humility, respect, and purpose.
